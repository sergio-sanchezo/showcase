## Carlos Alberto Cortés Ramírez

My name is Carlos. I am a software engineer student at Universidad Nacional de Colombia, currently enrroled in the seventh semester. I am a big believer of self-learning as a important player in personal growth. 

**Among my career interests are:**

- Mathematics
- Data Science
- Mobile and Web Development

**Aspirations on the course**

Although Visual Computing has not been the most interesteing topic to me in the past. In the first classes the topic have caught my attention, particularly the part of visual illusions, i think it is fascinating how our brain can intrepret the reality in a certain way that is not necessarily the truth, and doing so, create very interesting effects.

**Hobbies**

- Football
- Weightlifting
- Pool
