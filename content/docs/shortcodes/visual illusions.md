Moiré patterns: These are interference patterns that occur when two grids or patterns are overlaid on top of each other, resulting in a rippling effect. Moiré patterns are often used in printing and textile design to create unique and visually appealing textures.

Stereograms: Stereograms are 2D images that contain hidden 3D information that can only be seen when viewed in a certain way. They are often used in medical imaging to create 3D representations of internal organs or structures.

Peripheral drift illusion: This illusion occurs when the edges of a stationary pattern appear to be moving. It is often used in visual arts to create dynamic and visually engaging designs.

Opponent-process theory: This theory explains how our brains process color information by pairing colors into opposing pairs (red-green, blue-yellow, and black-white). It has practical applications in color vision research and color management for printing and digital imaging.

Hermann grid illusion: This illusion occurs when gray dots appear at the intersections of a white grid on a black background. It is often used in visual arts to create striking and abstract compositions.

Motion aftereffect: This is a phenomenon where a stationary object appears to be moving after watching a moving object for an extended period. It is used in neuroscience research to study motion perception in the brain.

Ponzo illusion: This illusion occurs when two identically sized objects appear to be different sizes because of their surrounding context. It has practical applications in product design and advertising to create the illusion of size or depth.
