Take advantage of monocular cues to implement a 2D sketch to trick the eye into perceiving a 3D scene. Introduction # Monocular cues provide depth information when viewing a scene with one eye. There are several effects that are based on this type of illusions, such as:
Motion parallax Kinetic depth effect Perspective Relative size In this particular case we will focus on the motion parallax. When an observer moves, the apparent relative motion of several stationary objects against a background gives hints about their relative distance.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://sergio-sanchezo.github.io/showcase/docs/shortcodes/visual-illusions/aplications_visual_phenomena/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergio-sanchezo.github.io/showcase/docs/shortcodes/visual-illusions/aplications_visual_phenomena/</guid><description>Exercise Study, implement and discuss possible applications of some known visual phenomena and optical illusions. Introduction # In visual perception, an optical illusion (also called a visual illusion) is an illusion caused by the visual system and characterized by a visual percept that arguably appears to differ from reality. Illusions come in a wide variety; their categorization is difficult because the underlying cause is often not clear but a classification proposed by Richard Gregory is useful as an orientation.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://sergio-sanchezo.github.io/showcase/docs/shortcodes/visual-illusions/moire_kinegram/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergio-sanchezo.github.io/showcase/docs/shortcodes/visual-illusions/moire_kinegram/</guid><description>Exercise
Implement a kinegram and some moiré patterns which are close related visual phenomena to masking. Introduction # In mathematics, physics, and art, moiré patterns or moiré fringes are large-scale interference patterns that can be produced when a partially opaque ruled pattern with transparent gaps is overlaid on another similar pattern. For the moiré interference pattern to appear, the two patterns must not be completely identical, but rather displaced, rotated, or have slightly different pitch.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://sergio-sanchezo.github.io/showcase/docs/shortcodes/visual-illusions/masking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergio-sanchezo.github.io/showcase/docs/shortcodes/visual-illusions/masking/</guid><description>Exercise
Implement in software an image processing web app supporting different image kernels and supporting:
Image histogram visualization. Different lightness (coloring brightness) tools. Kernel transformations # Kernel transformation with convolution is a technique used in image processing to apply a filter or transformation to an image. In this technique, a small matrix, called a kernel or filter, is moved over the image, and for each pixel, the values of neighboring pixels are multiplied by the corresponding values in the kernel, and the results are summed up.</description></item></channel></rss>
