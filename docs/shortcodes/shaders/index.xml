Implement some posteffects you find interesting. Introduction # Post effects, in the context of computer graphics, refer to the application of visual filters, transformations, and enhancements to an already rendered image or frame. These effects are typically used to modify the appearance, mood, or style of the image by altering its colors, textures, shapes, or overall visual characteristics. Post effects can include techniques such as blurring, sharpening, color grading, distortion, bloom, motion blur, and many others.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://sergio-sanchezo.github.io/showcase/docs/shortcodes/shaders/image_processing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sergio-sanchezo.github.io/showcase/docs/shortcodes/shaders/image_processing/</guid><description> Exercise

Introduction # The goal in procedural texturing is to procedurally generate a texture using an algorithm in such a way that the result can be mapped onto a shape as a texture. Procedural texturing requires the use of a frame buffer object which in p5.js is implemented as a p5.</description></item></channel></rss>
